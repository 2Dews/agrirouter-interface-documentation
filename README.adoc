== What is the agrirouter?
More information on agrirouter can be found link:./docs/general.adoc[here]

As a developer it's also interesting to understand the link:./docs/basic-concepts.adoc[basic concepts]

=== Purpose of this documentation

The purpose of this documentation is to create deep knowledge about the third party integration into the agrirouter solution. It shall include all information necessary to develop an integration with the agrirouter interface in an application.


=== Call for Participation

This documentation is an open source project. We invite everybody to open issues, fork the documentation or create pull requests to fix or extend this documentation.

== Adding your solution to agrirouter
In general, there are 4 major topics to add your software or hardware to the agrirouter ecosystem.

Steps 1, 2 and 3 can be started in parallel

* link:./docs/provider-agreement.adoc[1. Provider Agreement] 
* link:./docs/marketplace.adoc[2. Marketplace]

For the whole integration process (3.x and 4.x) it makes sense to first understand the link:./docs/basic-concepts.adoc[basic concepts of agrirouter].

* link:./docs/training.adoc[Training]


=== Development Resources

A list of tools for the agrirouter development as well as a list of libraries and usefull development resources can be found link:./docs/development-resources.adoc[here].

The keys and certificates required for communication can be found link:./docs/keys.adoc[here].

</p>
++++

=== 3.1 Registration
To start the development, you will need to link:./docs/registration.adoc[create a developer account].

=== 3.2 Register & Submit your solution

For communication with agrirouter, you need to setup an link:./docs/applications.adoc[application] in the Quality assurance environment.

=== 3.3 Waiting approval by support team

Whenever you create a new application version, agrirouter support team will have to approve this application. Please send an email to support@my-agrirouter.com including the application version ID to request confirmation.

=== 3.4 Integration

The integration with agrirouter is described in the link:./docs/general-integration-process.adoc[general integration process].

The following chapters describe all requirements to integrate an application with agrirouter.

==== Before we begin
First, you should always keep in mind the link:./docs/integration/general-conventions.adoc[General conventions].

There are several environments for test and production in different areas of the world. They can be found in the link:./docs/integration/environments.adoc[Environments].

==== Connecting your app instance
FarmingSoftware and Telemetry Platforms have to perform an link:./docs/integration/authorization.adoc[Authorization Process] to clarify, that the account user is known.

To communicate with the agrirouter, an application Instance needs to be link:./docs/integration/onboarding.adoc[onboarded]. An application instance can be link:docs/integration/reonboarding.adoc[ReOnboarded] or all application instance of a specific customer can be link:docs/integration/revoke.adoc[Revoked].


=== Communicate with agrirouter endpoints

To send a message, it has to be built first. Read link:./docs/integration/build-message.adoc[here] about building messages and commands.

Every application instance can link:./docs/integration/message-sending.adoc[send messages] and commands the same way.

While link:./docs/tmt/overview.adoc[messages] are meant to be forwarded to other endpoints, link:./docs/commands/overview.adoc[commands] are used to link:./docs/commands/ecosystem.adoc[explore the ecosystem], link:./docs/commands/endpoint.adoc[configure your endpoint] and link:./docs/commands/feed.adoc[request messages from the feed].

Command results and messages from other endpoints will be link:./docs/integration/message-receiving.adoc[received through the outbox] by the receiving application instance.

Messages from other endpoints are put into the outbox by link:./docs/integration/push-notification.adoc[push notifications] as well as by link:./docs/commands/feed[requesting the feed content].


Depending on the  link:./docs/integration/analyze-result.adoc#ResponseType[resultType], the Result can be link:./docs/integration/analyze-result.adoc[analyzed].

=== 4.1 Create developer account

Ones you're done with testing in QA, you can link:./account.adoc[create an account in the productive environment].

=== 4.2 Register & submit your solution

For communication with agrirouter, you need to setup an link:./docs/applications.adoc[application] in the productive environment.



=== 4.3 Certification

Every app needs to be certified to communicate with the agrirouter. Further information can be found link:./docs/certification.adoc[here].

=== 4.4 Approve from support team


=== 4.5 Test Interface & Messaging

=== 4.6 Approve for your end customer



== Maintenance

=== Usage metrix

As an application provider, you can download link:./docs/usage-metrix.adoc[usage metrics] to check, which account consumed how much data.


=== Endpoint management

Learn, how to manage your applications endpoints link:./docs/application-endpoint-management.adoc[here].

=== Behaviour after SoftwareUpdate

Read here, how to handle link:./docs/update.adoc[new versions and updates].


=== Service & Support

For feature requests or bug reports, you can link:./docs/service-support.adoc[contact the support.]

In case you experience unexpected connection issues, also check the availability of agrirouter at the link:https://my-agrirouter.com/support/system-status[Status Page].
