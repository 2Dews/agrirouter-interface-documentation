=== What is the agrirouter?
More information on agrirouter can be found link:./docs/general.adoc[here]

=== Purpose of this documentation

The purpose of this documentation is to create deep knowledge about the third party integration into the agrirouter solution. It shall include all information necessary to develop an integration with the agrirouter interface in an application.

This repository includes the documentation of the interface for the agrirouter solution.
Its main purpose is to allow developers to onboard their applications to the agrirouter.

=== Call for Participation

This documentation is an open source project. We invite everybody to open issues, fork the documentation or create pull requests to fix or extend this documentation.

= Adding your solution to agrirouter
In general, there are 3 major topics to add your software or hardware to the agrirouter ecosystem.

[NOTE]
====
The steps 1, 2 and 3 can be started in parallel, which means that your marketing department could setup the marketplace entry, while your developers are implementing the agrirouter API and your legal department handles the app provider agreement.
====

= Provider agreement
++++
<p align="center">
 <img src="./assets/images/general/process_firstcontact.png"><br>
</p>
++++
For legal reasons, it is required that every app provider signs the app provider agreement. 
You can get this document by contacting the DKE staff contacting Dr. Ing Jens MÃ¶ller, see link:https://my-agrirouter.com/en/company/contact/[the contacts page].

[NOTE]
====
These contacts are only relevant for the business side, for development support, please refer to the link:./docs/service-support.adoc[Service&Support]
====

= Marketplace

The market place for link:https://my-agrirouter.com/en/marketplace/apps/[Apps] or  link:https://my-agrirouter.com/en/marketplace/telemetryconnection/[Hardware] lists all compatible components of the agrirouter ecosystem.
At this place, you can list your solution.
Learn more about the setup of your marketplace entry link:./docs/marketplace.adoc[here].

== Basics
=== Concepts and Ecosystem
To integrate your software solution with agrirouter, you should first understand how the link:./docs/ecosystem.adoc[ecosystem] of agrirouter works.

In general, the communication consists of 3 steps:

</p>

For further communication, it's important to understand the link:./docs/endpoint.adoc[Elements of an endpoint] and the link:./docs/communication.adoc[Basics of Communication].

When developing a telemetry platform, the link:./docs/telemetry-platform-concepts.adoc[concepts of a telemetry platform] should be understood.

=== Terms and short descriptions

A short description naming all the agrirouter specific terms and their connection to each other can be found link:./terms.adoc[here]

A list of shortings can be found link:./docs/shortings.adoc[here]

A glossary can be found link:./docs/glossary.adoc[here]

There are several ids required for communication, a list of descriptions can be found link:./docs/ids-and-definitions.adoc[here].

== Registration
To start the development, you will need to link:./docs/registration.adoc[create a developer account].

== Application management

For communication with agrirouter, you need to setup an link:./docs/applications.adoc[application].

== Development Resources

A list of tools for the agrirouter development as well as a list of libraries and usefull development resources can be found link:./docs/development-resources.adoc[here].

The keys and certificates required for communication can be found link:./docs/keys.adoc[here].


== Integration

The integration with agrirouter is described in the link:./docs/general-integration-process.adoc[general integration process].

The following chapters describe all requirements to integrate an application with agrirouter.

=== Before we begin
First, you should always keep in mind the link:./docs/integration/general-conventions.adoc[General conventions].

There are several environments for test and production in different areas of the world. They can be found in the link:./docs/integration/environments.adoc[Environments].

=== Connecting your app instance
FarmingSoftware and Telemetry Platforms have to perform an link:./docs/integration/authorization.adoc[Authorization Process] to clarify, that the account user is known.

To communicate with the agrirouter, an application Instance needs to be link:./docs/integration/onboarding.adoc[onboarded]. An application instance can be link:docs/integration/reonboarding.adoc[ReOnboarded] or all application instance of a specific customer can be link:docs/integration/revoke.adoc[Revoked].


=== Communicate with agrirouter endpoints

To send a message, it has to be built first. Read link:./docs/integration/build-message.adoc[here] about building messages and commands.

Every application instance can link:./docs/integration/message-sending.adoc[send messages] and commands the same way.

While link:./docs/tmt/overview.adoc[messages] are meant to be forwarded to other endpoints, link:./docs/commands/overview.adoc[commands] are used to link:./docs/commands/ecosystem.adoc[explore the ecosystem], link:./docs/commands/endpoint.adoc[configure your endpoint] and link:./docs/commands/feed.adoc[request messages from the feed].

Command results and messages from other endpoints will be link:./docs/integration/message-receiving.adoc[received through the outbox] by the receiving application instance.

Messages from other endpoints are put into the outbox by link:./docs/integration/push-notification.adoc[push notifications] as well as by link:./docs/commands/feed[requesting the feed content].


Depending on the  link:./docs/integration/analyze-result.adoc#ResponseType[resultType], the Result can be link:./docs/integration/analyze-result.adoc[analyzed].

== Testing the application
Before publishing the app for everyone, it should be tested. Therefore, you can link:./docs/invite-testers.adoc[invite beta testers] from your developers account.

== Certification

Every app needs to be certified to communicate with the agrirouter. Further information can be found link:./docs/certification.adoc[here].


== Maintenance

=== Usage metrix

As an application provider, you can download link:./docs/usage-metrix.adoc[usage metrics] to check, which account consumed how much data.


=== Endpoint management

Learn, how to manage your applications endpoints link:./docs/application-endpoint-management.adoc[here].


=== Behaviour after SoftwareUpdate

Read here, how to handle link:./docs/update.adoc[new versions and updates].


=== Service & Support

For feature requests or bug reports, you can link:./docs/service-support.adoc[contact the support.]
