== General Overview

A communication with agrirouter requires several, partly parallel actions to take. The following Figure shows one possible workflow.

=== Communication Protocols

The agrirouter offers two different communication protocols for the common communication:

* REST via HTTP(S)
* MQTT

The commands exchanged with the agrirouter are protobuf encoded (in both directions). MQTT clients MUST send commands as base64 encoded strings embedded into a JSON frame structure.

REST based clients have the choice to transfer the commands in the same format as required for MQTT (base64 encoded protobuf nested in JSON structure). For REST, it is also possible to send native protobuf.

The advantage of using MQTT is that polling for message delivery (see following chapters) will not be needed. REST however has to be used anyway for the registration of the endpoint. Therefore, applications have to be able to do REST communication anyway.

The internal Google Protocol Buffer (protobuf) definitions for the communication with the agrirouter are available in GitHub repository under following URL: https://github.com/DKE-Data/agrirouter-api-protobuf-definitions 

== agrirouter Endpoints

This chapter gives an overview about the endpoints including their base requirement and definition. This chapter gives a high-level overview about the agrirouter Connectivity-Platform architecture, an application can interact with.

== Authorization process for endpoints

[IMPORTANT]
====
App providers, whose software receives data have to pay for these data. The authorization process is used by application providers to assign each endpoint with a known user of their software.
====


The authorization process is major for farming software and telemetry platforms, for CUs it is an optional function.

For CUs, this requires additional infrastructure, DKE advices to use the TAN exchange process.

=== Account authorization for farming software

As application providers of farming software have to pay for the consumption of raw data, the application provider should make sure, that only such agrirouter accounts can onboard one of his applications, that he can assign to one of his users. Otherwise, fake accounts could consume data on his costs.

==== Authorization Process Overview

The authorization process works as follows:

To better understand, what happens here, try the following:

====

1.  Call https://httpbin.org/get in your browser. You’ll get a JSON view of the get request
2.  Call https://httpbin.org/get?Param1=Value1&Param2=Value2 in your browser. You’ll get a view of the get request

* https://httpbin.org simply echoes the request that is send to the page. That’s important to understand

====

==== Generating an authorization Link

To provide a link for authorization, create a link like this:

__*\{\{agrirouter-url}}/application/\{\{applicationID}}/authorize?\{\{response-type}}&\{\{state}}&\{\{redirectURL}}*__


//TODO: Remove this with the real command in the final document
[NOTE] 
====
The detailed request is described in Integration Guide Part 2 (see Purpose of further documents
====

==== Perform authorization

When the user clicks on the link, the agrirouter website is called. If the user is currently not logged in, he has to log in. After logging in, he is delivered a website to authorize the connection between agrirouter and the application provider:

==== Analyses result

agrirouter sends an HTTP 301 redirect to the browser, encoding the authorization result in the get queue.

The details of this answer are described in Part 2 of the integration Guide.

=== Authorization for CUs and non-cloud-software

To perform authorization for software, that is not provided as a cloud solution, a small cloud onboarding service could be created to handle the onboarding communication:

=== Creating a registration code (TAN)

==== For CUs

The TAN for a new CU can be created by the end user clicking “Generate TAN”(1) in agrirouters’ control center. He has to select the desired CU(2) and gets a 10-digit code consisting of letters and numbers(3). A CU needs an interface to input this registration code.

==== For applications

Applications can either receive a TAN like CUs or as part of the authorization process.
//TODO: , see 10.3 Authorization process for endpoints

==== For virtual endpoints of telemetry platforms

Virtual CUs can be onboarded by their telemetry platform, a TAN generation is not required.

=== Onboarding Request

To onboard a new endpoint, the endpoint has to send an onboarding request providing the TAN to agrirouter.

As a result, the agrirouter will return a JSON object including the endpoint IDs and the certificates required for the further communication with agrirouter. The onboarding request shall only be done once per Application Instance. The used unique app instance ID however should be stored, as it is required for reonboarding.

[NOTE]
====
 There is no MQTT onboarding mechanism, so onboarding always has to be done using REST.
====

An example for an onboarding request can be found in the postman collection, which is part of Integration Guide Part 2.
//TODO: Upload also postman collection

== Reonboarding

Whenever an app instance receives an update of its software, it possibly needs to reonboard to agrirouter to receive its certificates and the endpoint IDs again. Reonboarding equals the onboarding request. Important is, that the same app instance id is used again, so that agrirouter recognizes the reonboarding and the routings and group settings of the endpoint persist. Otherwise, it would create a new endpoint.

== Communication and Message exchange

=== The onion principle of commands and messages

agrirouter is a platform, that is mostly used to transport messages *through* it and not towards it.


//TODO Format this
Therefore, the content is encapsulated

=> in messages, which are encapsulated into

    => the commands to the agrirouter, which are encapsulated into

        => the protocol layer of REST or MQTT.

With except to the EFDI telemetry messages (DeviceDescription and timelogs), agrirouter doesn’t analyse the messages inside the agrirouter command. It just checks the message type and the addressing to determine the recipients based on the routings and subscriptions.

 <img src="./../assets/images/ig1\image33.png" width="621px" height="358px"><br>
 <i>The onion principal for a non-telemetry message</i>
</p>
++++




An exception are the EFDI messages.

The device descriptions are needed by the agrirouter to

* determine the relevant CU when sending a Message directly to a machine
* filter for DDIs that are allowed to be sent to specific endpoints

The timelog telemetry data is analyzed, so that a filtering for value categories like fuel consumption is possible.

=== Sending messages

An endpoint can send messages to other endpoints via the agrirouter. Therefore, it has to create commands to call at the agrirouter. To send a message to agrirouter, the application has to encode the involved file format,

<p align="center">
 <img src="./../assets/images/ig1\image35.png" width="622px" height="347px"><br>
 <i>Required Data to create a message</i>
</p>
++++




//TODO This has to be more precise, can be 200 to 299
The message is answered by the agrirouter with a HTTP status, that might be 200 (OK). In that case, the endpoint can poll for a confirmation at the outbox before sending the next message.

agrirouter commands like the request for messages are Protobuf-Encoded.

== Requesting messages

=== General

agrirouter stores messages of an endpoint in its feed. This feed is part of the message module. Requesting a message from the agrirouter equals sending a command to the inbox, requesting agrirouter to forward the message to the outbox. The endpoint can than receive this forwarded message through the selected protocol. For HTTP REST, the endpoint has to poll at the address of the outbox. If the endpoint uses the MQTT protocol, it will receive the message from the agrirouter.

 <i>Handling of messages and commands inside agrirouter endpoint; Simplified</i>
</p>
++++



=== Requesting available messages

To receive a list of all buffered messages from the feed of the endpoint, the application has to request the list of available messages. agrirouter will than forward a message header list to the outbox. The app instance can request each message by its unique ID afterwards. It’s up to the developer to decide on a useful order of requesting the buffered messages. Ann application could for example use the principles of _last in first out_ or _first in first out_ or priories specific technical message formats. It would also be possible for timelogs to request every n-th message and requests the messages in between afterwards, so that the app could create a graph, that is getting more and more precise (like a preview becoming a real view).

=== Relevant Message formats

The message formats relevant to control the agrirouter are available on the GitHub: https://github.com/DKE-Data/agrirouter-api-protobuf-definitions . A full documentation of those messages can be found in the Integration Guide Part 2.

More relevant message formats can be found in the resources List of this document.

=== Resumable transfer for binary content

++++
<p align="center">
 <img src="./../assets/images/ig1\image37.png" width="642px" height="351px"><br>
 <i>Transfer for Binary Content</i>
</p>
++++



Regarding large data, endpoints need to implement a concept for chunked data transfer to ensure a resumable transfer of (binary) content. The endpoint is in charge of the segmentation, this is not done by the agrirouter. The agrirouter is in charge of the delivery and order of the messages.

If the app instance intends to send binary content to its endpoint, the app instance segments the binary content into smaller chunks of a determined size of at maximum 1 MB. Afterwards the client envelopes these chunks into the agrirouter message protocol and sends those chunks each as a single message to the agrirouter. The client has to ensure that the binary relevant header information in the agrirouter message header is filled correctly. The agrirouter transports the messages without changing the content to the feed of the receiver and the client receives those chunks message by message and then can reassemble the binary content again.

[IMPORTANT]
====
 * The segmentation of message does not apply to the telemetry related data as it is described in EFDI.

 * The max chunk size is capped at 1MB. This size might be decreased during the project for performance reasons.

== Telemetry platform integrations

To simplify and optimize the connection of telemetry platforms, there are several additional functionalities for such platforms. A telemetry platform can onboard virtual CUs itself, so that it is not necessary to enter a TAN in the terminal of a virtual CU

=== Integration Concept

 <i>Telemetry platform Integration Concept Overview</i>
</p>
++++




=== Device Onboarding

A certified telemetry platform (having received a certificate by DKE) can onboard new virtual CUs in an automated way. The agrirouter provides a designated API for automated virtual CU onboarding.

=== Virtual CU and Messaging

Regarding messaging, there is no difference between a real-world CU and a virtual CU onboarded by a certified telemetry platform. The connecting telemetry platform has to implement the same communication pattern as it applies to all other endpoints categories.

//TODO: Rework this part
[IMPORTANT] 
====
There will be a trusted Relationship between the agrirouter and certified telemetry platform. The communication between the telemetry platform and the agrirouter can be realized using HTTP(S) based REST communication or MQTT messaging over a designated messaging component accepting both protocols. As mentioned before the payload has to be Google Protocol Buffer encoded, the communication pattern will be asynchronous most of the time.
