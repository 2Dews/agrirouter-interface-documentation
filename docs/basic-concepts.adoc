=== Ecosystem

The agrirouter ecosystem and the members of it are described in the chapter link:./ecosystem.adoc[ecosystem].

=== Applications and App Instances

In each agrirouter account, there are different types of communication partners, which are called app instances:

 <i>The different types of app instances: CU, Application, Virtual CU, Machine, Account</i>
</p>
++++

The list of link:./ecosystem.adoc#applications[Application Types] helps to find out, which type of application you should create.

=== Endpoints
Each app instance communicates with its corresponding endpoint in the agrirouter.

For communication, it's important to understand the link:./endpoint.adoc[elements of an endpoint].

=== Communication
 
To communicate with agrirouter, it's important to understand the link:./communication.adoc[basics of communication]

==== Messaging Workflow

The communication workflow describes, which messages have to be send to agrirouter to exchange information with the agrirouter endpoint.

This workflow can be found in the chapter link:.//messaging-workflow.adoc[messaging workflows].

==== Message Exchange

The message exchange describes the exchange of messages between application instances over the agrirouter.

The basic concepts of message exchanged are described in the link:./message-exchange.adoc[concepts of message exchange]
This chapter handles, for example, the concepts of addressing members of the ecosystem.



=== Life cycle 
In general, the life cycle of an Endpoint consists of 3 steps:

* link:./integration/onboarding.adoc[Onboarding]
* Communication (see above)
* link:./integration/revoke.adoc[Offboarding/Revoking]

== Terms and short descriptions

A short description naming all the agrirouter specific terms and their connection to each other can be found link:./terms.adoc[here]

A list of shortings can be found link:./shortings.adoc[here]

A glossary can be found link:./glossary.adoc[here]

There are several ids required for communication, a list of descriptions can be found link:./ids-and-definitions.adoc[here].
