=== Message formats

If a message format is missing, please send us an email to support@my-agrirouter.com. DKE will check, if there is a common need for this. Please provide the following information with any request:

* *Name:* What’s the name of the new format?

* *Type:* What message type would the new format fit the best? E.g. PNG would fit to a message type “Images”

* *Scope:* What is this message type used for? If possible, please provide a use case.

* *Documentation:* Is the format already documented? Please provide information on the required standard.

* *Ability of participation:* If DKE recognizes, that the format is not yet standardized or that there are multiple possible formats, it’s very likely, that DKE will request you and other requesters to agree on a common format. Please state, that/if you are wanting to participate in such a group.

* *Timeline:* Please provide a timepoint, for which you would need the new format


agrirouter support team will get back to you on your request, please be informed, that this could take a while. For test purposes, you can however start your development with a proprietary format.
