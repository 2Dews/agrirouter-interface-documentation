== General Overview

The onboarding workflow is needed to onboard app instances and create endpoints in the agrirouter. The result of the onboarding process has to be stored.

== Workflow for Farming Software and Telemetry Systems

Telemetry systems and Farming Software need to assign their own userID to the accountID of the user at the agrirouter. Therefore, a verification should be performed before onboarding.

</p>
++++


[NOTE]
====
The CU onboarding mechanism needs less steps than the Farming Software and Telemetry software, as it is only required for those applications consuming data to know which user is assigned to which account.

The following parts of onboarding are *not* required for CU onboarding:

* Authentication
** Entering certificates in the agrirouter UI
** Adding a redirect URL in the agrirouter UI
* Verification
* onboarding with a Signed request
====

== Workflow for Virtual CUs

Onboarding virtual CUs through a telemetry platform is done using a command. This will in particular be described later. 
//TODO See 16.5 Commands for telemetry platforms

From the end user’s perspective, it is mostly dependend on the telemetry platform, if there is any selection mechanism or if it is done automatically.

== Creating a Registration Code

=== Using the agrirouter UI

The Registration code for a new CU can be created by the end user clicking “Generate TAN” in agrirouters’ control center. He has to select the desired CU  and gets a 10-digit code consisting of letters and numbers . A CU needs an interface to input this registration code.

</p>
++++


=== As result of the authentication

If the authentication prozess is done using parameter _response_type=onboard_, the result will include a regcode. This regcode is a TAN.

=== Telemetry Platforms

A telemetry platform has to be onboarded using the authentication process. Once it is onboarded, it can onboard virtual CUs by itself. Therefore, it can use a special command. as Commands are described in a later chapter.
//TODO:  please refer to 16.5.1 Onboarding a Virtual CU.

== Collecting and setting up relevant information

The onboarding request requires several different information:

=== ApplicationID and X-Agrirouter-ApplicationID

Both IDs are the same, they can be found in the agrirouter software endpoint UI of the developers account:

 <img src="./../../assets/images/ig2/image22.png" width="455px" height="258px"><br>
<i>Finding the applicationID</i>
</p>
++++



=== CertificationVersionID

The CertificationVersionID is the ID unique to this specific app certification process. It can be found when clicking on the required Endpoint Software Version:

 <img src="./../../assets/images/ig2/image23.png" width="519px" height="294px"><br>
<i>Finding the certificationVersionID</i>
</p>
++++


=== Setting up private and public key

[NOTE]
====
This step is not required for CUs
====

As the requests need to be signed (see 8.8Signing requests), the public key has to be stored within the agrirouter. This can be done, calling “Edit” on the Endpoint Software Management Screen (see Figure 17 Finding the applicationID ). The agrirouter UI offers the possibility to create a key pair, you can however create your own one and just store the public key on agrirouter.

== onboarding Endpoint URLs

The endpoint URL differs, depending on your desired geolocation and the Quality Assurance or Productive Environment.

The request must be a HTTP Post request to

[cols="2,1,5",options="header",]
|=======================================================================================================================================================================================
|Environment |Area |URL
|Quality Assurance |EU1 |https://agrirouter-registration-service-hubqa-eu1.cfapps.eu1.hana.ondemand.com/[https://agrirouter-registration-service-hubqa-eu1.cfapps.eu1.hana.ondemand.com]
|Production |EU1 |https://agrirouter-registration-service.cfapps.eu1.hana.ondemand.com/[https://agrirouter-registration-service.cfapps.eu1.hana.ondemand.com]
|=======================================================================================================================================================================================

[NOTE]
====
Like every URL in this document, these URLs might change in the future or there might be additional ones for new Areas.
====

== Signing requests

For onboarding, the agrirouter must be sure, that the requests actually come from an instance of the app specified in the request. Therefore, the payload must be signed with the applications private key. The corresponding public key must be maintained by the developer in agrirouter per application, see Setting up private and public key.

A Payload encryption is not needed since all communication is encrypted with TLS

All signatures used for the onboarding and revocation process shall be created by:

* hashing the request body (SHA256)
* then using the private key to create an RSA signature of the hash
* Create HEX representation of this hash
* Add the hex string as “X-Agrirouter-Signature” to the header of the HTTP call

Agrirouter will look up the public key for the app id specified and verify the signature.

== Sending a Verification Request

The verification request is used to actually check, if the endpoint is for the desired application and account before actually onboarding it.

=== General

The address for the verification request is as follows:

[cols="1,5",options="header",]
|==========================================
|Method |Address
|POST |api/v1.0/registration/onboard/verify
|==========================================

=== Request Information

The app instance has to send a HTTP Post request.

==== Header Information

===== For CU onBoarding

For CUs, this is not required or available

===== For FarmingSoftware and Telemetry Platform onBoarding

The Request shall include the following header information:

[cols="2,1,3",options="header",]
|=============================================================
|Name |Type |Description
|Authorization |String |“Bearer “+ the TAN
|Content-Type |String |application/json
|X-Agrirouter-ApplicationId |String |[Application Id]
|X-Agrirouter-Signature |[Signature] |see 8.8 Signing requests
|=============================================================

==== Body Information

The request body includes the same parameters as the onboarding requests body:

The request body is a JSON object including the following Parameters and is equal for any type of onboarding:

[cols="1,3,2,5",options="header",]
|================================================================================================================
|# |Name |Type |Description
|1 |id |String |The unique ID of the endpoint; we advice to create a URN
|2 |applicationId |String |The application ID for the application, provided in the agrirouter developer UI
|3 |certificationId |String |The ID of the certification software version provided in the agrirouter developer UI
|4 |gatewayId |String a|
The desired communication protocol after onboarding

2: MQTT

3: REST

Example: “2”

|5 |certificateType |String a|
Type of the desired certificate;

Possible values: PEM,P12

|6 |UTCTimestamp |String |A Timestamp like this: _2018-06-20T07:29:23.457Z_
|7 |timeZone |String |A TimeZone like this: “+03:00”
|================================================================================================================

//TODO: Create CODE Template
[source,javascript]
----
{

"id": "urn:myapp:snr00003234",

"applicationId": "e0eb00ff-e2ef-4429-85f5-2559aceedd6d",

"certificationVersionId": "e0eb00ff-e2ef-4429-85f5-2559aceedd6d",

"gatewayId": "3",

“UTCTimestamp”: “2018-06-04T12:00:03.000Z”,

“timeZone”: “+02:00”

}
----

=== Verification Result

The result is a HTTP response code with a JSON object in the Body

==== Result codes

There are different result HTTP Status codes indicating the result

[cols=",",options="header",]
|=============================================================================
|Code |Describtion
|200 |The validation was successful
|400 |There was an error in the request
|401 |The request was unauthorized; the provided registration code was unknown
|=============================================================================

==== Body Information

===== Success

For a successful result, the body will include a JSON object like this:

[source,javascript]
----
{

"accountId": "4823443c-fd0d-44a7-81a6-06104455945a"

}
----

It includes the accountId, so that an app provider can check, if this accountId might already be known. For apps, that can be onboarded only once (like an FMIS, where it doesn’t make any sense to have 2 of the same kind), this would mean, that onboarding is not needed.

===== Failure

In case of Failure, an error message is provided.

== Sending Onboarding Request

To onboard a new endpoint, the endpoint has to send an onboarding request providing the registration code to agrirouter.

The request is a HTTP POST request.

[NOTE]
====
There is no MQTT onboarding mechanism, so onboarding always has to be done using REST.
====

=== Request information for signed onboarding

[NOTE]
====
This is the onboarding request for Farming Software and Telemetry platforms, not for CUs.

===== Handling Signature Issues

If you experience problems with an invalid signature, (Code 107), try the following:

* make sure, you encoded the whole body
* compare the signature with the result of the node server tool delivered with the postman collection
* check the timestamp. If your local time is ahead of or too far behind agrirouter servers time, it will not recognize the signature as valid. The agrirouter HTTP answer includes a timestamp reporting agrirouters server time.
