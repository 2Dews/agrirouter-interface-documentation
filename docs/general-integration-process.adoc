After the first contact with the company DKE-Data and signing the App- and Hardware Provider agreement, an agrirouter developer account can be created in the agrirouter quality assurance (QA) environment.

In the developer account, a new application (farming software, communication unit or telemetry platform) can be added. The app provider has to create a first Certification version in the UI, that can be approved by DKE.

Afterwards, it is possible to register and onboard app instances of this app as well as any other app. It is important to know, that the quality assurance environment is not made for real life productive data exchange, but only for test of the connectivity of a software. The number of endpoints, that can be created on the quality assurance environment is limited.

Once the connectivity to agrirouter is successfully developed and tested, the developer sends a request to agrirouter support team for starting a certification process.

DKE will provide a list of trusted partners for agrirouter certification on the https://my-agrirouter.com/support/ website.

If the agrirouter certification of the application is successful, it is recommended to do live test on the agrirouter production environment with real accounts of selected farmers. The developer can add those accounts to his test environment in the developersâ€™ user interface.

To release the new application to public, the app provider can create an application description in the agrirouter marketplace. See https://my-agrirouter.com/marketplace/apps/
