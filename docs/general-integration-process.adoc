To maximize the quality of the agrirouter ecosystem, there are several requirements development of applications. This chapter shall describe all necessary steps for the development of the application to integrate this app with the agrirouter.

In the developer account, a new application (farming software, communication unit or telemetry platform) can be added. The app provider has to create a first Certification version in the UI, that can be approved by the agrirouter support team.

Afterwards, it is possible to register and onboard app instances of this app as well as any other app. It is important to know, that the quality assurance environment is not made for real life productive data exchange, but only for test of the connectivity of a software. The number of endpoints, that can be created on the quality assurance environment is limited.

Once the connectivity to agrirouter is successfully developed and tested, the developer sends a request to agrirouter support team for starting a certification process.

A list of trusted partners for agrirouter certification can be found link:https://my-agrirouter.com/en/support/certification/[here]

If the agrirouter certification of the application is successful, it is recommended to do live test on the agrirouter production environment with real accounts of selected farmers. The developer can add those accounts to his test environment in the developersâ€™ user interface.

After release of the software, the registered application instances can be link:./docs/application-endpoint-management.adoc[maintained], e.g. based on the link:./docs/usage-metrix.adoc[usage metrics]
