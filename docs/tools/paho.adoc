== What is Paho?

Paho is an Eclipse tool to connect to an MQTT broker. Further information on the tool can be found link:https://www.eclipse.org/paho/[at the project page]


A description on how to install paho can be found link:https://help.sap.com/viewer/e9e5e6a2fa144c31b5b5d5c144047dec/Cloud/en-US/13db11a65036448ea5194b2a8e922c62.html[here]

== Preconditions
=== OpenSSL
To format the certificates, link:https://www.openssl.org/[openssl] is required.

=== Install TrustStore

To communicate with the agrirouter via MQTT two certificates are required. The first certificate is a general certificate to communicate with the server, the second certificate is the one that is client specific.

First, the general certificate need to be added to your systems trust store. Download those certificates following this link:../keys.adoc[keys page].

To add the certificates to your local trust store:

* First copy the .pem-File(s) to the location of JAVA_HOME\lib\security (your local JRE-installation).
* Start a console and navigate to JAVA_HOME\lib\security (cmd.exe on windows; **Important**: Admin rights might be required.)
* Run the following command, where "changeit" should be the keyword of your keystore (default, if you did not change it)

[source,bash]
----
keytool -import -alias ca -file eu-qa-ca-cert.pem -keystore cacerts -storepass changeit
----

This keystore is described in the Paho UI as "Truststore"

==Communication with a specific client


== Setup Endpoint in MQTT
=== Create KeyStore
Onboarding an MQTT endpoint provides a certificate, an MQTT client id and two topics; see link:../integration/onboarding.adoc[onboarding].

Alternatively, the connection can be setup using a link:../router-device.adoc[router device].

The certificate received from onboarding process needs to be formatted to work with PAHO (PAHO only, not needed for most of the other clients):

* Copy the whole certificate field, replace the "\n" with line breaks (\r+\n) and save it to a *.pem file
* Call the following command from within the folder you stored the *.pem file:
[source,bash]
----
openssl pkcs12 -export -in myCert.pem -inkey myCert.pem -out myCert.jks
----


=== Setup Paho SSL Connection

Open the connection options and enable SSL. Then add the certificate files for truststore (general MQTT Certificates) and keystore (your onboarding results certificate)
