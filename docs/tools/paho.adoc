== What is Paho?

Paho is an Eclipse tool to connect to an MQTT Broker. Further information on the tool can be found link:https://www.eclipse.org/paho/[at the project page]


A description on how to install paho can be found link:https://help.sap.com/viewer/e9e5e6a2fa144c31b5b5d5c144047dec/Cloud/en-US/13db11a65036448ea5194b2a8e922c62.html[here]

== Preconditions
=== OpenSSL
To format the certificates, link:https://www.openssl.org/[openssl] is required.

=== Install TrustStore

To communicate with MQTT, there are 2 certificates required. The first one is a general certificate to communicate with the server, the second one is the one that is client specific. 

First, the general certificates need to be added to your systems trust store. Download those certificates at the link:../keys.adoc[keys page].

To add them to your keystore:

* copy the .pem-File(s) to the location of JAVA_HOME\lib\security (so, your jre-Installation). 
* Start a console and navigate to JAVA_HOME\lib\security (cmd.exe on windows; **Important**: Admin rights might be required)
* Run the following command, where "changeit" should be the keyword of your keystore (default, if you did not change it)

[source,bash]
----
keytool -import -alias ca -file eu-qa-ca-cert.pem -keystore cacerts -storepass changeit
----

This keystore is described in the Paho UI as "Truststore"

==Communication with a specific client


== Setup Endpoint in MQTT
=== Create KeyStore
Onboarding an MQTT endpoint delivers a certificate, an id and two topics; see link:../integration/onboarding.adoc[onboarding].

Alternatively, the connection can be setup using a link:../router-device.adoc[router device].

The certificate received from onboarding needs to be formatted to work with PAHO:

* Copy the whole certificate field, replace the "\n" with line breaks (\r+\n) and save it in an *.pem file
* Call the following command from within the folder, where you stored the .pem-File:
[source,bash]
----
openssl pkcs12 -export -in myCert.pem -inkey myCert.pem -out myCert.jks
----


=== Setup Paho SSL Connection

Open the connection options and enable SSL. Then add the certificate files for truststore (general MQTT Certificates) and keystore (Your onboarding results certificate)
