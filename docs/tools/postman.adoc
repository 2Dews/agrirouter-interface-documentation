== What is postman?

Postman is a tool to send http requests and analyze results, usable for full test chains for online APIs. You can download postman here: https://www.getpostman.com/

With this integration guide, a postman collection is delivered, including the endpoint definitions and abstractions for the different environments.

== Check onboarding

== Adding a Certificate

For an SSL Secured communication, add the certificate delivered with the onboarding request:

1. Copy&paste ENCRYPTED PRIVATE KEY section to new file

2. Replace all \n with new lines.

3. Save both sections (ENCRYPTED PRIVATE KEY and CERTIFICATE) in separate files (e. g. DEVICE_MYEXTERNALID.key, DEVICE_MYEXTERNALID.crt)

4. Provide both in Postman Settings / Certificates, including the passphrase provided in the onboarding response.
