== In General

Every application needs to be certified to be onboardable to the agrirouter. The certification ensures, that the communication protocol of the agrirouter is successfully implemented and the application is able to communicate correctly with the agrirouter.

A certification is needed any time, the app changes its capabilities or their sending directions, changes the commands or uses a different protocol to communicate with the agrirouter.

[NOTE]
=====
For a new certification version, capabilities can never be removed. Neither can a sending direction of a capability be removed. It is only allowed to add capabilities or sending directions for a new version. The capabilities command however can of course only include a subset that is smaller than in the version before.
=====

== Out of focus

The certification will not check, if an application is able to work with the data sent over the agrirouter. The process will only check, if the application can send and receive data for the technical message types, that were selected for the certification version.

== Certification companies


There are multiple certification companies, a list can be found link:https://my-agrirouter.com/support/certification/[here].


== Certification Requirements

To pass the certification tests, there are several requirements, of which several have to be fulfilled before the certification can start.

=== Prerequists

*  The link:./provider-agreement.adoc[DKE App Provider Agreement] has to be signed
*  The link:./marketplace.adoc[Marketplace entry] has been created with "Coming soon" label
* Following information are available about the company:
** Name
** Address (where billing and offer shall be placed by certification company)
*  Following information are available for a first level customer support:
** Email
** Address
** Phone
** URL
* A link:./registration.adoc[quality assurance environment developer account of the app provider]
* application Id and certification version Id of link:./applications.adoc[an application in the quality assurance environment].

== Further requirements

The following information are not necessary to start the certification but will be required before finishing it:

* A link:./registration.adoc[production environment developer account of the app provider]
* application Id and certification version Id of link:./applications.adoc[an application in the production environment].
* Version, name and description of the application to certify
* message protocol (MQTT/REST)
* message format (JSON/Native Protobuf)
* The capabilities of the app including link:./tmt/overview.adoc[the technical message types] and the sending directions
* A list of link:./commands/overview.adoc[all commands], that are used by the app
* Is this an initial certification or a recertification for a new version of an existing software?


== Certification tests
Not all of the certification tests are necessary for your implementation. 

The selection depends on several parameters and attributes of the specific application. These parameters are listed in the following chapters

=== Based on the application type

Based on the type of your application, different tests might be required. Check link:./applications.adoc[here], which type suites your requirements best.

=== Based on commands

It will be checked in advance by the certification company, which commands are supported by your software in which characteristic. Those will be checked. Here is an overview of the commands:

[cols="1,2,9",options="header",]
|====
|MessageType |Condition |Description
|link:./commands/endpoint.adoc#capabilities-command[dke:capabilities] | Always |Endpoint to announce ist capabilities in terms of technical message types that can be sent / received

|====




=== Based on other conditions


==== Apps sending messages
[REMARK]
=====
These tests are only required, if your application can send data 
=====


[cols="1,2,9",options="header",]
|====
|MessageType |Condition |Description
|link:./integration/build-message.adoc#chunking-big-messages[Building chunks] | link:./tmt/overview.adoc[All TMTs except for EFDI] |Split big messages into several messages before sending. 
| Base64 encoding |link:./tmt/overview.adoc[All TMTs except for EFDI]  |Base64 encoding binary data before building the message 
| Exchange Zip Folders| link:./tmt/taskdata.adoc[TaskData] and link:./tmt/shape.adoc[Shape] | Accessable zip folders need to be sent 

|Message Adressing

| Always 

a| The different ways to send a message will be checked, depending on which of these functionalities your application supports:

* Sending a message directly to one receipient
* Sending a message directly to multiple receipients
* Publishing a message
* Publishing a message and sending it directly to 1 receipient
* Publishing a message and sending it directly to multiple receipients

| <<Buffering>> | Always| Buffer data, if agrirouter connection fails
|====




==== Apps receiving messages
[REMARK]
=====
These tests are only required, if your application can receive data 
=====

[cols="1,2,9",options="header",]
|====
|MessageType |Condition |Description
|Merging chunks | link:./tmt/overview.adoc[All TMTs except for EFDI] |Reconnect the split big messages.
|link:./integration/push-notification.adoc[Push notifications] |Always (Optional)  | It's tested, if push notifications are activated in the link:./commands/endpoint.adoc#capabilities-command[capabilities message]

It's tested, if pushed messages are confirmed
|====


    
==== Based on message protocol layer and message format

If your software supports REST or MQTT with JSON, sending and receiving of those formats is checked.

If your software supports REST with NativeProtobuf, sending and receiving of those formats is checked.


=== General requirements
==== Timestamps
It will be tested, that the software uses UTC Timestamp for every message, it sends. See also the link:./integration/general-conventions.adoc[general conventions].

==== Id requirements

* Every application message Id has to be a UUID.
* On every start up, the sequence number needs to start at 1 and has to be incremented with every command/message.
* The link:./integration/general-conventions.adoc#string-identifiers-convention[external Id requirements] will be checked

==== Account management

If supported, it's checked, if a CU correctly changes the agrirouter endpoint, it is communicating with, when the account in the CU is changed.

==== Clean your feed
After the several tests of receiving or rejecting messages, it will be checked if the feed is empty. So: Make sure, your feed will be cleaned by either requesting and confirming or deleting messages. For the certification, the rule of cleaning your feed applies with a shorter period of time to clean it, just by practical reasons of the certification. Please check the specific time periods with your certification company.

==== Test coverage for telemetry platforms
For telemetry platforms, it will be checked in advance of the test, which functionalities are required for the platform itself and which functionalities are required for its Virtual CUs. 
Telemetry platforms must at least support the onboarding and offboarding; see above. They can however also support other functionalities like Farming Software. In this case, additional tests apply for the platform itself. 

==== Buffering

If the internet connection gets lost or agrirouter is not available for another reason, the application instance shall buffer data, that needs to be sent, when the connection is reastablished.

The app instance needs to check for reconnection on its own.

== Recertification cases

An application has to be recertified, if one of the following things apply:

* A new technical message type and/or direction is supported by your application
* The basic message protocol (MQTT or REST) has changed
* The basic message format (JSON or Native Protobuf) has changed
* The list of implemented commands changed
* Push Notifications are activated in the capabilities
