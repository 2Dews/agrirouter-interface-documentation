== Major development technologies

To perform an agrirouter integration, you will need knowledge to the following technologies:

* *Required:*
** *REST*; at least for onboarding, perhaps for communication (see https://wikipedia.org/en/REST )
** *Protobuf*: for message packaging (see https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/ )
** Certificates, signatures and encrypted communication, e.g. using HTTPs
* *Optional*
** *secured MQTT* for the communication (see https://mqtt.org)
** *ISO11783* and *EFDI* for telemetry data
//TODO: Link EFDI

= Annex B (Shortings)

As agrirouter uses multiple, sometimes quite long special terms, these terms are shortened in some of the graphics. Following a list of shorting’s and the corresponding full term

== Tools

=== Endpoint recording

Every agrirouter account includes a functionality to record communication on that account and specific for every endpoint. To record data, the user can start and stop the recorder in the agrirouter UI.

Figure 43 Start Recording of messages & commands

After recording started, the recording is displayed in the list of active records. Multiple records at the same time are possible to record multiple endpoints.

Figure 44 Recording overview

Recording can be stopped (1), downloaded (2) or deleted (3).

[IMPORTANT] 
====
Every account may store 10 recordings with a maximum size of 10 MB in a sum.
====

=== Replay of records

In a developer account, records can be uploaded (1) additionally to the recording functionalities, that are available in both account types; end user and developer.

Figure 45 Endpoint recording in a developer account

As a developer, you are able to replay recorded commands (2); replacing the endpoint ID with any other endpoint ID.

This will be described in more detail in Integration Guide Part 2.
