== Major development technologies

To perform an agrirouter integration, you will need knowledge to the following technologies:

* *Required:*
** *REST*; at least for onboarding, perhaps for communication (see https://wikipedia.org/en/REST )
** *Protobuf*: for message packaging (see https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/ )
** Certificates, signatures and encrypted communication, e.g. using HTTPs
* *Optional*
** *secured MQTT* for the communication (see https://mqtt.org)
** *ISO11783* and *EFDI* for telemetry data
//TODO: Link EFDI




== Development Tools

* For REST Tests, you can use the link:docs/tools/postman.adoc[Postman Collection]

* For MQTT Tests, you can use link:docs/tools/paho.adoc[Paho]

* Especially for Protobuf Development, you can use the link:docs/tools/arts.adoc[Agrirouter Protobuf Toolset]

* To create and play traces, use the link:/docs/tools/endpoint-recording.adoc[Endpoint Recording]
