= Concepts of agrirouter

== Introduction

To understand integration with agrirouter, it's important to understand its background concepts. This chapter shall give an introduction to these concepts used in agrirouter.

=== Telemetry Platforms and Virtual CUs

A telemetry platform can communicate in behalf of itself and all of its Virtual CUs.
All communication is performed zwischen that telemetry platform and its in- and outbox.
However, it is important to understand, that the telemetry platform itself as well as each virtual CU has its own Feed, EndpointList, Subscription and Capabilities. To communicate with these specific part of the endpoint, the sensorAlternateId of the relevant partner (telemetry platform itself or one of its Virtual CUs) has to be used.

The telemetry platform handles the on- and offboarding of virtual CUs, therefore, the sensorAlternateId in every on- and offboarding message for virtual CUs has to be the sensorAlternateId of the telemetry platform itself.
